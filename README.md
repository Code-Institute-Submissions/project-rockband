The Travelers rockband project.

I have used the same techniques as I have learned in the previous module.
The programs I used are:
-CSS 
-Bootstrap
-Fontawesome
-jQuery

Because it is all new for me, I decided to take the resume project as a wireframe and go from there. 
I made a basic but, in my opinion clear and simple design, with minimal clutter. 
All the information one can want is there, like a subscribe page for updates, media like video's and photo's, 
a tourguide to see when and were the band is performing and a news page to read about the band.
I did not use any text of any website, instead I filled the text where applicable with the Lorum Ipsum generator.

The page is designed for the fans of the made up band the Travelers. The informastion states it is a band which performes for over 50 years. 
With that in my I decided to keep the site clean and simple, but also give it a modern look. This to attreact both the older and the younger crowd.


The images used i got from the following sites and were free to use:

Not all images were used.

The video's used come from Youtube. I linked them via the embed function which Youtube offers, to link video's to webpages.
I did a little research about the use of this method on the website:

As to my understanding I did not break any rules or law as far as I know, using this method.

The project is uploaded to github under the name project-rockband.
